1.1.0 :
    - Now generates automatically the config file
    - The /pds reloadconfig works correctly
    - Cleaning the code
    - Before, if the player has a usable block in the second-hand, he could place it
    - Moving the persistent property from 'special' to 'creative' (question of logic with the new property 'distance')
    - Adding new properties :
        - Wall : applies on walls, defines which faces are connected (special)
        - Snowable : applies on grass block, defines if the block is snowy or not (special)
        - Distance : applies on leaves, defines how far the block is from tree has to be to disappear (if they aren't 'persistent')
        - Layers : applies on snow, defines their layers of snow
    - Adding 2 new loggers a player change a property (each can be disabling) :
        - In the console
        - In files, one file per day stocked in the "logs" directory, to not flood the console
    - Adding a way to prevent the player that his debug stick will break soon
    - Adding the possibility to create your own recipes for the debug stick
